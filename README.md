#Project Description

This project is named neCloud (pronounced “Any Cloud”). The name is self-explanatory. What we are trying to achieve with this project is an abstraction over API provided by different cloud providers. There are many small to medium sized project which uses different clouds like AWS, Google cloud etc. They mostly rely on four services out of hundreds of services provided by Cloud providers. These 4 services include, computing, storage, database and queue. Now, database and computing usually do not have any tight coupling with the project code but other two does. Once any project uses API from any particular cloud provider they are stuck with them forever until and unless they make changes in their code. We are trying to eliminate dependency from cloud provider API and provide an API which works with all cloud providers by just changing some configurations.
